<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Sets and Subsets</h2>
<p>The foundation of modern mathematics is the theory of sets. Informally, sets can be thought of as collections of objects. While <strong>set theory</strong> is not specifically outlined in the content standards of most states, it is mentioned in the Common Core standards. The first reference to set theory occurs in the Introduction to Kindergarten, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Students use numbers, including written numerals, to represent quantities and to solve quantitative problems, such as counting objects in a set; counting out a given number of objects; comparing sets or numerals; and modeling simple joining and separating situations with sets of objects, or eventually with equations such as <span class="math inline">\(5 + 2 = 7\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(7 - 2 = 5\)</span>. (Kindergarten students should see addition and subtraction equations, and student writing of equations in kindergarten is encouraged, but it is not required.) Students choose, combine, and apply effective strategies for answering quantitative questions, including quickly recognizing the cardinalities of small sets of objects, counting and producing sets of given sizes, counting the number of objects in combined sets, or counting the number of objects that remain in a set after some are taken away. <span class="citation">(NGA-CCSSO, <a href="#ref-CCSS" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Set theory also makes an appearance in the high school standards related to counting and probability, as knowledge of sets is critical to understanding basic formulas in probability.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="related-content-standards-1" class="unnumbered">Related Content Standards</h4>
<ul>
<li>(HSS.CP.1) Describe events as subsets of a sample space (the set of outcomes) using characteristics (or categories) of the outcomes, or as unions, intersections, or complements of other events (“or,” “and,” “not”).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We start our exploration of set theory by developing some basic notation and definitions. <span class="citation">Cantor (<a href="#ref-Cantor" role="doc-biblioref">1891</a>)</span> defined sets in the following way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unter einer ‘Menge’ verstehen wir jede Zusammenfassung <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> von bestimmten wohlunterschiedenen Objecten <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> unsrer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens (welche die `Elemente’ von <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> genannt werden) zu einem Ganzen. (p. 481)</p>
<p>By a ‘Set’ we mean each collection <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> of certain well-differentiated objects <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> of our perception or our thinking (which are called the `elements’ of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>) as a whole. (English translation)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition proved to not be precise enough to avoid certain paradoxes.</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-5" class="example"><strong>Example 2.1  (Russell’s Paradox)  </strong></span> Let <span class="math inline">\(R= \left\{ x \middle \vert x\notin x\right\}\)</span>, the set that contains all sets that are not members of themselves. Is <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> an element of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>? If it is, then it is a set that is an element of itself and so could not be an element of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, by its definition, thus leading to a contradiction. On the other hand, if one assumes that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is not an element of itself, then it satisfies the conditions of being an element of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, also leading to a contradiction. Thus defining the paradox.
</div>

<p>Even though Cantor’s definition of a set leads to such paradoxes, we will use it as our working definition, with the detailed definition of set being a primitive notion in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. The Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, combined with the axiom of choice, create the ZFC axioms upon which mathematics is built. Due to the level of abstraction involved in the axioms, we will not include a systematic coverage of the axioms in this text, but will reference them as needed.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unnamed-chunk-6" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.1  </strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>We will define a set by the collection of elements which belong to the set.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a set and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is an object that belongs to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we say that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is an <strong>element</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and denote it as <span class="math inline">\(a\in A\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If an object <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is not an element of a set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we denote that by <span class="math inline">\(a \notin A\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be sets. We say that <span class="math inline">\(A=B\)</span> if and only if every element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is an element of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and every element of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is an element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. (In the ZFC axioms, this is referred to as the axiom of extensionality.)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>While the elements of a set are often written in a specific order, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3\}\)</span>, the members of a set have no particular order and the same set could be written as <span class="math inline">\(\{3, 1, 2, 1\}\)</span>, with the repetition being irrelevant since the set is defined by its elements.</p>
<p>We also need to note that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> are two different mathematical objects (one is the element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and the other is the set that contains the element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>). So <span class="math inline">\(A = \{a, \{a\}\}\)</span> defines a set with two distinct elements: <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span>. Likewise, if <span class="math inline">\(B=\{1, 2, 3, \{4\}, 5\}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(4\notin B\)</span> but <span class="math inline">\(\{4\}\in B\)</span>. So the symbol <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> is not an element of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, but the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\{4\}\)</span> (the set that contains the element <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>) does belong to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. These nuances mean that we have to be very careful with our notation and how we read the mathematical symbols.</p>
<p>Another way to describe sets is using set-builder notation. In this notation, we describe our new set using larger sets and a set of restrictions on (or description of) which objects in the larger set we are choosing to include. For instance, we can define <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> to be the set of all real numbers (denoted <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>) greater than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. In this case, the larger set is the set of real numbers and the condition that the numbers are greater than or equal to three is the restriction or description. Of course we do not want to have to keep writing so much down, so we create a short-hand way of defining this set:
<span class="math display">\[ C = \left\{ x\in \mathbb{R} \middle \vert x\geq 3\right\}\]</span> where the <span class="math inline">\(\vert\)</span> separates the description of the larger set and the description of the restrictions. This notation is read “<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the set of all of the elements <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the real numbers such that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is greater than or equal to 3.” This set-builder notation is particularly useful when describing sets with more than just a few elements.</p>
<p>When sets are subsets of the real numbers, we can also describe them using interval notation. For the set <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> defined above, we can also write
<span class="math display">\[C=[3,\infty)\]</span> where the closed bracket, <span class="math inline">\([\)</span>, denotes that the endpoint is contained in the set, while an open bracket, <span class="math inline">\((\)</span>, denotes that the endpoint is not contained in the set. For real numbers <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;b\)</span>, we have the following options as intervals from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[ (a,b) \quad (a,b] \quad [a,b) \quad [a,b] .\]</span></p>
<p>Once we have created notation for sets with a few elements and a large number of elements, we can describe how to denote a set without any elements.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:unnamed-chunk-7" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.2  </strong></span> The set that does not contain any elements is called the <strong>empty set</strong> and is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span>. Any set that contains at least one element is then called <strong>non-empty</strong>.
</div>

<p>In addition to determining how to describe sets, we must have a way to determine if two sets are the same or distinct.</p>
<p>A direct consequence of this definition is that the number of times an element is listed and the order of the elements is irrelevant for equality of sets. So <span class="math inline">\(\{a, b, c, d\}=\{b, a, c, c, d, b\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{1, 2\} \neq \{1, 2, 3\}\)</span>.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:subset" class="definition"><strong>Definition 2.3  </strong></span> Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be sets. We say that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq B\)</span>, if every element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is also an element of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is not a subset of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, we sometimes denote this by <span class="math inline">\(A\nsubseteq B\)</span>. If there are elements of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and there are elements of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> that are not contained in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, then we say that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a <strong>proper subset</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and denote it by <span class="math inline">\(A\subset B\)</span>.
</div>

<p>For example:
<span class="math display">\[\{6, 7 \} \subseteq \{5, 6, 7, 8\},\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\{x\in \mathbb{R} \vert x&gt;5\} \subseteq \{x\in \mathbb{R} \vert x \geq 2\}, \mbox{ and }\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[ \{a,b,c\} \subseteq \{a,b,c\}. \]</span>
Notice that the first two examples are proper subsets.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the phrases ‘element of’ and ‘contained in’ when discussing sets. If <span class="math inline">\(A= \{a,b,c\}\)</span>, then we say that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is an element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\(\{a\}\)</span> is contained in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span></p>
<p>Since the empty set has no elements, it is by default a subset of every set. Similarly, every set is a subset of itself.</p>

<div class="example">
<span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-8" class="example"><strong>Example 2.2  </strong></span> If <span class="math inline">\(A=\{a,b,c\}\)</span> we can describe all of the subsets of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[ \emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{a, b, c\}.\]</span>
This set of subsets of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is called the <strong>power set</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(A)\)</span>.
</div>

<p>We often need to prove that two sets are equal to one another, and we do not have the elements of the set listed out. In these situations the following theorem often proves useful.</p>

<div class="theorem">
<span id="thm:set-equality" class="theorem"><strong>Theorem 2.1  </strong></span>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be sets. <span class="math inline">\(A=B\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B \subseteq A\)</span>.
</div>


<div class="proof">
<p> <span class="proof"><em>Proof. </em></span> Since the statement of the theorem is an ‘if and only if’ statement, there are actually two components that need to be proven. We need to first prove that if <span class="math inline">\(A=B\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B \subseteq A\)</span>. The second statement that needs proving is the converse: having <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B \subseteq A\)</span> implies that <span class="math inline">\(A=B\)</span>. We will complete both arguments using the corresponding definitions.</p>
<p>Assume that <span class="math inline">\(A=B\)</span>. Then the definition of set equality states that every element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is an element of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. This means that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> meets the definition of a subset of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. That is: <span class="math inline">\(A\subseteq B\)</span>. In addition, the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(A=B\)</span> gives us that every element of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is an element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. As a result, <span class="math inline">\(B\subseteq A\)</span>. Thus <span class="math display">\[A=B \Rightarrow A\subseteq B \mbox{ and } B\subseteq A.\]</span></p>
<p>To prove the converse statement, we assume that <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B \subseteq A\)</span>. Thus, we have that every element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is also an element of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and every element of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is also an element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. This is the definition of set equality and so we have that <span class="math inline">\(A=B\)</span>.</p>
<p>We have therefore proven both implications, and thus the theorem is proven.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Venn Diagrams</h3>
<p>In order to better understand relationships between subsets of a larger set, it is sometimes helpful to represent the relationships with a <strong>Venn diagram</strong>. In these diagrams, we use circle-like figures to represent sets, with everything inside the circle being inside of the set and everything outside of the circle being outside of the set.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-10" class="example"><strong>Example 2.3  </strong></span> Let <span class="math inline">\(A=\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B=\{3, 6, 9\}\)</span>. Then these sets could be represented by a Venn diagram such as the one below.</p>
</div>

<p><img src="tikz/VennEx2-1-6.png" width="35%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>As previously discussed, sets do not have to just be composed of numbers. Moreover, sets can have many different relationships between them, as seen in Figure . If a set is a subset of a second set, then they are visualized as one region inside of the other region. If there are elements shared between two sets, but are not known to have a subset relationship, then they are visualized as overlapping regions. If no elements of the two sets are the same, then they are represented as two non-overlapping regions. In the next section we define vocabulary to describe these different types of relationships and how they are combined in different ways.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> List of Sets of Numbers</h3>
<p>In order to help with terminology we will provide some notation for some of the basic sets used in the text.</p>
<p>We define the natural numbers as
<span class="math display">\[\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,\ldots\}.\]</span>
This is distinct from some definitions of the natural numbers that do not include the number <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. When a text defines the natural numbers without the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, it also defines the whole numbers to be our definition of the natural numbers. We are including <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> due to the method in which we define the natural numbers in Chapter <a href="4-ch-number.html#ch:number">4</a>.</p>
<p>We label the integers as <span class="math display">\[\mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\},\]</span> which we will define in detail in Section <a href="4-1-sec-Integers.html#sec:Integers">4.1</a>.</p>
<p>We label the set of rational numbers as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> and the real numbers as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, the detailed definitions of which are in Sections <a href="4-3-sec-rationals.html#sec:rationals">4.3</a> and <a href="4-5-sec-reals.html#sec:reals">4.5</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>The complex numbers, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>, are defined and studied in Section <a href="4-6-sec-complex.html#sec:complex">4.6</a>.</p>
<p>For the integers, rationals and reals, we define <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^+\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}^+\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^+\)</span> to be the positive elements of the set, those that are greater than zero.</p>
<p>We visualize the nested nature of these number systems in the Venn diagram in Figure <a href="2-1-sets-and-subsets.html#fig:venn-numbers">2.3</a>.</p>

<li><p>Some textbooks describe a set as ``a well-defined collection of objects’’ which means that the inclusion criteria that helps you decide what should be in the set is clearly specified. Classify each of the following sets as well-defined or not. If you identify a set as not well-defined, give two possible well-defined sets that would satisfy the original description.</p>
