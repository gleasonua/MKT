A large portion of this knowledge is acquired through experience working with students. However, excellent teachers develop certain aspects of knowledge through structured learning environments like a textbook or university course. This textbook is inspired by Usiskin et al. (2003) and designed to help current and future teachers explore a unique blend of mathematical content knowledge used in the practice of teaching mathematics at the secondary and early post-secondary level. Content examining how K-12 students learn mathematics or on classroom management techniques related to mathematical teaching are left to other texts. There are many excellent resources for this pedagogical content knowledge, particularly from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) and the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators (AMTE). For the Student For the Instructor One Semester Course Two Semester Courses Three Semester Courses Focus on Middle School Content References "],["acknowledgements.html", "Acknowledgements", " Acknowledgements "]]
