<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Representations of Rational Numbers</h2>
<p>Each rational number can be represented in several different ways, with the most prominent being as a mixed number, a fraction, a decimal, or a percent. In this section we will discuss how to convert between these different representations and how to use other physical and graphical representations to understand and use rational numbers.</p>
<div id="decimal-representations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Decimal Representations</h3>
<p>It is sometimes helpful to write rational numbers in a decimal representation, rather than fraction notation. This is particularly true in the comparison of two rational numbers. One process for finding the decimal representation from a fraction is long division, but it is often simpler to use technology to find the decimal representation. (It also greatly reduces the amount of error involved.) However, it is important to have a deeper understanding of the decimal representation of rational numbers to verify that the result obtained from a calculator or computer is correct. For instance, if one uses a calculator to find <span class="math inline">\(\frac{8}{17}\)</span>, a calculator with an 8 digit display will give the answer <span class="math inline">\(0.4705882\)</span>, and a calculator with a 16 digit display will give the answer <span class="math inline">\(0.470588235294118\)</span>. There is no apparent repetition in this decimal, leading to the question of if it repeats or not. It is the repeated use of the division algorithm that allows us to determine why a decimal representation of a rational number always repeats.</p>

</ol></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We will state the division algorithm for integers here, but the proof is in Section <a href="#sec:Integer-Ring"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>

<div class="theorem">
<span id="thm:unnamed-chunk-97" class="theorem"><strong>Theorem 4.7  (The Division Algorithm for Integers)  </strong></span>If <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are integers with <span class="math inline">\(b&gt;0\)</span>, then there are unique integers <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[a=bq+r, \quad \mbox{with } 0\leq r &lt;b.\]</span>
</div>

<p>We will explain the process of long division and its relationship to the division algorithm to determine the decimal representation of rational numbers using an example.</p>
<p>In order to find the decimal expansion of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{7}{12}\)</span>, we will first rewrite the rational expression as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{10} \cdot \frac{70}{12}\)</span>. We then note that <span class="math inline">\(70=12\cdot 5 + 10\)</span> in the division algorithm. Thus,
<span class="math display">\[\frac{7}{12} = \frac{1}{10} \cdot \frac{70}{12} = \frac{1}{10} \cdot \left( 5 + \frac{10}{12}\right)= \frac{5}{10} + \frac{1}{10} \cdot \frac{10}{12}.\]</span> We continue this process with <span class="math inline">\(\frac{10}{12}\)</span> so that we have <span class="math display">\[\frac{7}{12}= \frac{5}{10} + \frac{1}{10^2} \left(\frac{100}{12}\right) = \frac{5}{10} + \frac{1}{10^2} \left(8 + \frac{4}{12}\right)= \frac{5}{10} + \frac{8}{10^2} + \frac{1}{10^2} \cdot \frac{4}{12}.\]</span> We continue the process, so that <span class="math display">\[\frac{7}{12} = \frac{5}{10} + \frac{8}{10^2} + \frac{1}{10^3} \cdot \frac{40}{12} = \frac{5}{10} + \frac{8}{10^2} + \frac{3}{10^3} + \frac{1}{10^3} \cdot \frac{4}{12}.\]</span> We notice that this remainder of <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> again tells us that we will get the same quotient again and again. Therefore, we see that
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{7}{12} = 0.58\overline{3}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As we can see with this process, a decimal will start repeating when a remainder in the division algorithm is repeated. Since the only possible remainders of a quotient by <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span> are in the set <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\}\)</span>, we see that any decimal representation of a fraction whose denominator is <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span> will repeat after at most 11 places.</p>
<p>Similarly, the decimal representation for any rational number will eventually repeat. This repetition may be of the digit <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, in which case we will call it a <strong>finite decimal expansion</strong>, or it may be a different number of digits, in which we will call it a <strong>repeating decimal expansion</strong>. In the case of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{7}{12}\)</span>, we see that the repeating happens after a certain number of digits. These types of decimal representations will be called <strong>delayed repeating decimal expansions</strong>. One can determine the type of decimal expansion based on the prime factorization of the denominator, once the fraction is written in its simplified form.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="related-content-standards-12" class="unnumbered">Related Content Standards</h4>
<ul>
<li>(8.NS.1) Know that numbers that are not rational are called irrational. Understand informally that every number has a decimal expansion; for rational numbers show that the decimal expansion repeats eventually, and convert a decimal expansion which repeats eventually into a rational number.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we know that all rational numbers can be represented by decimal expansions that are finite, repeating, or delayed repeating, we will study the process of starting with a decimal representation and determining a fraction representation. We already know that if the decimal representation does not repeat that it does not correspond to a rational number.</p>
<p>If the number has a finite decimal expansion, then it can be converted to a fraction using the base ten representation. For instance the number <span class="math inline">\(3627.854\)</span> can be rewritten as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3627854}{1000}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a decimal expansion that is repeating like <span class="math inline">\(0.\overline{35682}\)</span>. This could be written in the form <span class="math display">\[0.\overline{35682}= \frac{10^5}{10^5} 0.\overline{35682} = \frac{1}{10^5} \cdot 35682.\overline{35682} = \frac{1}{10^5} \left( 35682 + 0.\overline{35682}\right).\]</span> We can rearrange this equation so that
<span class="math display">\[10^5 \cdot 0.\overline{35682} - 0.\overline{35682} = 35682\]</span> or equivalently that
<span class="math display">\[0.\overline{35682} = \frac{35682}{10^5-1}.\]</span> This same process can be used to find the fractional representation of any rational number with a repeating decimal expansion.</p>
<p>If a rational number has a delayed repeating decimal expansion, then one can rewrite the number in a way to generate a repeating decimal. For instance,
<span class="math display">\[324.51\overline{89} = \frac{10^2}{10^2} \cdot 324.51\overline{89} = \frac{1}{10^2} \left( 32451.\overline{89}\right) = \frac{1}{10^2} \left( 32451+\frac{89}{10^2-1} \right) = \frac{(32451\cdot 99)+89}{9900}.\]</span></p>

For example, create a story context for <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{3}{4}\)</span> and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient; use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{3}{4} = \frac{8}{9}\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{4}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{8}{9}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span>. (In general, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad}{bc}\)</span>.) How much chocolate will each person get if 3 people share <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> lb of chocolate equally?

<p>Consider the following problem from the Singapore Mathematics Curriculum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jenny, Bob, and Paul shared a sum of money. Jenny received <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{5}\)</span> of the money, Bob received <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> of the money and Paul received the rest of the money. If Paul received <span class="math inline">\(\$1.50\)</span> more than Bob, how much more money did Jenny receive than Paul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this is not a modeling problem, in that this type of situation would never be described in this way, it does help generate fluency in working with different representations of rational numbers. We will walk through one possible solution that does not use variables, but does build the conceptual understanding necessary for successful work in algebra.</p>
<p>The first thing that we notice is that we need a way to represent <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{5}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> of the same whole. As such, we need our whole item to be broken into <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> equal sized pieces.</p>
<p><img src="tikz/singapore-fraction1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We then note that Jenny received <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{5}\)</span> of the money, which is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{8}{20}\)</span> of the money. So we will mark <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> of the pieces with a J. Similarly, Bob received <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> of the money and so we will mark <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> pieces with a B.</p>
<p><img src="tikz/singapore-fraction2.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We then see that Paul received the equivalent of 7 blocks, while Bob received 5 blocks. Since Paul received <span class="math inline">\(\$1.50\)</span> more than Bob we know that 2 blocks is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(\$1.50\)</span>, making each block represent <span class="math inline">\(\$0.75\)</span>. Since Jenny received the equivalent of 1 block more than Paul we see that she received <span class="math inline">\(\$0.75\)</span> more than Paul.</p>
<p>There are many other ways to solve this problem that also develop numerical fluency with rational numbers, and the more ways that students can represent these numbers and move between the representations, the more fluent they will be with the rational number system.</p>
<div id="fraction-strips" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2.1</span> Fraction Strips</h4>
<p>One common tool used to help students determine equivalent fraction representations is through the use of fraction strips. These are pieces of paper (all the same size), but marked off in different numbers of parts. Then by setting the pieces of paper next to each other, students are able to notice equivalency of fractions. For instance, in the fraction strips below one can see that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{4}\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="tikz/fraction-strip1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>One can also use fraction strips to represent the operation of division of fractions. For instance if we have the two fraction strips below we can use them to determine that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2} \div \frac{1}{6} = 3\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{6}\)</span> regions can fit inside of the <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> region.</p>
<p><img src="tikz/fraction-strip1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="pattern-blocks" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2.2</span> Pattern Blocks</h4>
<p>Another tool to help students work with fractions are pattern blocks. The pattern blocks most useful for many of the fractions that students use are the hexagon, triangle, trapezoid, and rhombus below.</p>
<p><img src="tikz/pattern-blocks.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Students can see that <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> triangles, <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> trapezoids, or <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> rhombi fit inside of the hexagon. So we can represent <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span> as two rhombi, with one hexagon representing the whole. One can then see that fractions whose denominator is <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> are easily represented using one hexagon as the whole. However, if we allow two hexagons to represent the whole, we can represent fractions with denominators of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span>. One can also think about <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2} \div \frac{1}{3}\)</span> as how many rhombi fit inside of one trapezoid.</p>
</div>
<div id="area-model" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2.3</span> Area Model</h4>
<p>The area model described in Section <a href="4-2-sec-integer-representation.html#sec:integer-representation">4.2</a> can help students to visualize multiplication of fractions. For instance, one can find the product of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{5}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span> using the following diagram. One can then see that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4}{15}\)</span> of the squares are shaded. So <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{15}\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="tikz/area-model-fractions.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We are also able to build upon the area model to visualize the distribution property involved in the multiplication of mixed numbers. If we want to find <span class="math inline">\(23\frac{2}{3} \times 32 \frac{5}{7}\)</span>, then we have to remember the convention that <span class="math inline">\(23\frac{2}{3} = 23 + \frac{2}{3}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(32\frac{5}{7}= 32 + \frac{5}{7}\)</span>. (Note how confusing this convention can be for students, particularly since in algebra two numbers next to each other represent multiplication instead of addition.) We can then allow for an abstract area representation (the sizes are not proportional) to more easily use the distributive property.</p>
<p><img src="tikz/area-model-Mixednumbers.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There are many other tools that can help students understand rational numbers and their operations, but we will leave those for more pedagogically oriented sources.</p>

<div id="number-line-and-plane" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2.4</span> Number Line and Plane</h4>
<p>It is also important for students to use rational numbers on a number line (and the associated plane). In particular, the number line can help students understand inequalities, relationships between different numbers, and the absolute value of a number. Some key factors to keep in mind are to not only have fractions between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, or only mixed numbers outside of that interval. Students need to use a variety of different numbers and representations together to gain fluency.</p>
