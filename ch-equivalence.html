<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Equality, Order, and Equivalence</h1>
<p>The chapter title may look like just a list, but the notions of equality, order, and equivalence are a critically important trio of related but distinct ideas in mathematics. Together they help us define when two things are the “same.” Instruction in these ideas starts on almost the first day of school when students first learn how to count. Students continue study and expand these ideas in their study of mathematics: many of the theorems of mathematics labeled as “Fundamental” are statements of equivalence. These include the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic that every integer can be uniquely factored into primes, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus describing the relationship between antiderivatives and infinite sums, and isomorphism theorems of abstract algebra and homeomorphisms of topology.</p>

Figure 3.1: Sorting Candy
</p>
</div>
<p>As a way to better understand the world, humans tend to sort information into categories or orderings. For instance, when some people see a pile of various types of M&amp;M’s<sup>TM</sup> they have the urge to sort them in various ways. Some people sort the candies according to their color. Others may sort them according to their type (plain, peanut, etc.). This process of sorting is a type of “partitioning” the items into distinct categories. With this categorization we want to make sure that each candy is sorted into one, and only one, type. This type of sorting can be formalized with the following definition.</p>
<div id="partitions" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Partitions</h3>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:unnamed-chunk-38" class="definition"><strong>Definition 3.1  </strong></span> A <strong>partition</strong> of a set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a finite or infinite collection of non-empty, mutually-disjoint subsets whose union is <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.

Figure 3.2: Partition of Sets
</p>
</div>
<p>Thus, a partition of a set is a collection of subsets of the original set with several key properties. First, the subsets are non-empty, meaning that each subset in the partition contains at least one element. This allows us to restrict the partition to a collection of non-trivial subsets and means partitions have a type of uniqueness. The subsets in the partition are also mutually-disjoint which means that no element of the original set is in more than one of the subsets in the partition. Lastly, since the union of the subsets that form the partition is <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we have that every element in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is in one of these subsets. Thus, each component of the definition of a partition is essential to defining a way to split a set into a set of categories that we find useful.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-40" class="example"><strong>Example 3.1  </strong></span>If we have a set
<span class="math display">\[A=\left\{ a, 2, \alpha , \mbox{apple} , \mbox{box}, \beta, 1, 3, \gamma , \mbox{cow}, c, b \right\}\]</span> there are some natural ways to partition the set. Here are three possible partitions.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
            A_1 = \{a,b,c\}, \:
            A_2 = \{1,2,3\},\: 
            A_3 = \{\alpha, \beta, \gamma\}, \: 
            A_4 = \{\mbox{apple} , \mbox{box}, \mbox{cow}\} 
\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[
            A_1 = \{\mbox{apple} , \mbox{box}, \mbox{cow}\}, \:
            A_2 = \{a,b,c,1,2,3,\alpha,\beta,\gamma\}
\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[
            A_1 = \{a,1,\alpha,\mbox{apple}\}, \: 
            A_2 = \{b,2,\beta,\mbox{box}\}, \: 
            A_3 = \{c,3,\gamma, \mbox{cow} \}
\]</span></p>
There are many other ways to partition the set, but we do not have the space to write out all of the possible partitions of this set.
</div>


<div class="example">
<span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-41" class="example"><strong>Example 3.2  </strong></span> Early in the K-12 mathematics curriculum we ask students to determine which integers are even and which are odd. In this situation, the set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the set of integers (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>), while the subsets that form the partition are the subset of even numbers, (<span class="math inline">\(2\mathbb{Z}\)</span>), and odd numbers, (<span class="math inline">\(2\mathbb{Z}+1\)</span>).
</div>


<div class="example">
<span id="exm:unnamed-chunk-42" class="example"><strong>Example 3.3  </strong></span>If we let the set <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be defined by the following list of elements,
<span class="math display">\[B = \begin{Bmatrix} 
\mbox{ jar},  &amp; \mbox{ jellybean} ,  &amp; \mbox{ applesauce}, &amp; \mbox{ ape}, &amp; \mbox{ bear}, \\
\mbox{ ball}, &amp; \mbox{ beanbag}, &amp; \mbox{ bag}, &amp; \mbox{ arm} , &amp; \mbox{ skate} , \\
\mbox{ bike}, &amp; \mbox{ rock}, &amp; \mbox{ rowboat},   &amp;  \mbox{ jigsaw}, &amp; \mbox{ saw}
 \end{Bmatrix}\]</span>
take some time to create various partitions of the set <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, verifying the various properties in the definition of a partition.
</div>

<p>In this text, we denote the partition <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> of a set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as the union of subsets of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> over some indexing set, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. For example, if the partition is formed using two subsets of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, then the indexing set could be <span class="math inline">\(I=\{1,2\}\)</span>. The indexing set can also be infinite. For instance,
<span class="math display">\[\mathcal{P} = \left\{ A_n  \right\}_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}, \: \mbox{ where } A_n=\left\{x\in \mathbb{R}\middle \vert n\leq x &lt; n+1  \right\}\]</span> is a partition of the real numbers with an infinite number of sets.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there are usually many ways to partition a set, but the definition of partition does not impose any constraints on the uniformity or order of the subsets, only that the way we choose our subsets meets the three conditions described previously.</p>
<p>With our previous discussion and examples in mind, we can translate our verbal definition of a partition into a symbolic one. In particular: if <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}= \left\{ U_i\right\}_{i\in I}\)</span> is a partition of a set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is some indexing set that is either finite or infinite, we have the following properties
<span class="math display">\[U_i \bigcap U_j = \emptyset \quad \mbox{if } i\neq j, \quad \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i = A \mbox{, and} \quad U_i \neq \emptyset \mbox{ for all } i \in I.\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="relations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Relations</h3>
<p>Up until this point we have focused on building a framework for understanding the notion of partition. In order to understand the main topics of this chapter, we also need to develop the idea of a relation. While we give the general definition of a relation and a few examples, we will focus on those relations that arise from partitions in this section. We will explore other types of relations in later sections.</p>

<div class="definition">

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Equivalence Relations Induced by Partitions</h3>
<p>For the remainder of this section we will study a specific type of relation that is created by a partition, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>, of a set, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}=\left\{U_i\right\}_{i\in I}\)</span> is a partition of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we can write <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as the union of a collection of non-empty, mutually disjoint subsets: <span class="math display">\[U_i \cap U_j = \emptyset \mbox{ if } i\neq j, \: \mbox{ for each } i \in I, \: U_i\neq \emptyset, \: \mbox{ and } A=\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i.\]</span></p>
<p>Consider one of the individual subsets in the partition, say <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span>. Then the elements of <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span>, by virtue of the fact they are in the same subset, have a relationship to each other. This idea extends to the whole partition. That is, the partition induces a relation on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in the following way. For each <span class="math inline">\(a,b\in A\)</span> we say that <span class="math inline">\(aRb\)</span> if, and only if, there is a set <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> in the partition <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> such that both <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are in <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>The relations we create through a partition behave in ways that are of general interest in the study of mathematics.</p>
<p>If we choose a generic element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, the property that <span class="math inline">\(\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i = A\)</span> tells us that there exists <span class="math inline">\(i\in I\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(a \in U_i\)</span>. So for every element <span class="math inline">\(a\in A\)</span>, we have that <span class="math inline">\(aRa\)</span>. We will call this property of the relation the <strong>reflexive property</strong>.</p>
<p>For the second property, if we have <span class="math inline">\(a,b\in A\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(aRb\)</span>, then there must be a <span class="math inline">\(U_i\in P\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a,b\in U_i\)</span>. This also means that <span class="math inline">\(bRa\)</span>. When you have the property that <span class="math inline">\(aRb\)</span> implies that <span class="math inline">\(bRa\)</span>, we say that the relation has the <strong>symmetric property</strong>.</p>
<p>The third property of relations that we define derives from the property of partitions that
<span class="math display">\[U_i \bigcap U_j = \emptyset \Leftrightarrow i\neq j.\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c\in A\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(aRb\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(bRc\)</span>, then we have that there are sets <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U_j\)</span> in the partition such that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are both in <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> are both in <span class="math inline">\(U_j\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is in both <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U_j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(U_i \cap U_j \neq \emptyset\)</span> and so <span class="math inline">\(i=j\)</span>. This would then imply that <span class="math inline">\(aRc\)</span>. This property that the combination of <span class="math inline">\(aRb\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(bRc\)</span> implies that <span class="math inline">\(aRc\)</span> is called the <strong>transitive property</strong> of relations.</p>
<p>Not all relations have these three properties of reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Those relations that have all three properties are called <strong>equivalence relations</strong>.</p>
<p>We have therefore proven that a partition of a set induces an equivalence relation on that set.</p>

<div id="partitions-induced-by-equivalence-relations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.4</span> Partitions Induced by Equivalence Relations</h3>
<p>The concept of equivalence relation is one that transcends much of mathematics and we often consider things as being the “same” with respect to some property if there is an equivalence relation under which they are related. One location that this appears in the elementary school curriculum is in regards to rational numbers. We think of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{4}\)</span> as being the same rational number, but written in a different way. Along these lines we say that two rational expressions <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{c}{d}\)</span> are equivalent if and only if <span class="math inline">\(ad=bc\)</span>. This creates and equivalence relation between these rational expressions that are used to create the rational numbers.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a relation, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, on a set, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, is an equivalence relation, then one can generate an induced partition, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>, as follows. For each <span class="math inline">\(a\in A\)</span> we define the set <span class="math display">\[[a]_R := \left\{ b\in A \middle \vert aRb\right\}.\]</span> We call this set, <span class="math inline">\([a]_R\)</span>, the equivalency class of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> under the relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is an equivalence relation, it is reflexive and so <span class="math inline">\(a \in [a]_R\)</span> causing <span class="math inline">\([a]_R \neq \emptyset\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(a\in [a]_R\)</span>, we have that <span class="math display">\[\bigcup_{a\in A} [a]_R = A.\]</span> Thus to show that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P} = \left\{ [a]_R \middle \vert a \in A\right\}\)</span> is a partition of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we need to show that for <span class="math inline">\(a,b\in A\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\([a]_R=[b]_R\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\([a]_R\bigcap [b]_R = \emptyset\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\([a]_R \bigcap [b]_R \neq \emptyset\)</span>, then we need to prove that two sets to be equal.</p>
<p>Let us assume that there exists a <span class="math inline">\(c\in [a]_R \bigcap [b]_R\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(d\in [a]_R\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(a R d\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is also in <span class="math inline">\([a]_R\)</span> and so <span class="math inline">\(aRc\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is symmetric and <span class="math inline">\(aRd\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(dRa\)</span>. We now have that <span class="math inline">\(dR c\)</span> using transitive property. <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is also in <span class="math inline">\([b]_R\)</span> and so <span class="math inline">\(bRc\)</span>. Using the symmetric property, we have <span class="math inline">\(cR b\)</span>. Combining this with <span class="math inline">\(dRc\)</span> and using the transitive property we have <span class="math inline">\(dR b\)</span>. Using the symmetric property we have <span class="math inline">\(bR d\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(d\in [b]_R\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\([a]_R \subseteq [b]_R\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using very similar arguments we can prove that <span class="math inline">\([b]_R \subseteq [a]_R\)</span>.</p>
<p>So if the intersection is nonempty, the two sets are the same set.</p>
<p>We have thus proven the following theorem showing the connection between equivalence classes and partitions.</p>

<div class="theorem">
<p><span id="thm:unnamed-chunk-44" class="theorem"><strong>Theorem 3.1  </strong></span>If <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is an equivalence relation on a set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[P = \left\{ [a]_R \middle \vert a \in A\right\}\]</span> is a partition of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
Similarly, if <span class="math inline">\(P= \left\{ U_i \middle \vert i \in I\right\}\)</span> is a partition on a set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, then the relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> defined by
<span class="math display">\[aRb \Leftrightarrow \mbox{ there exists } i \in I \mbox{ such that } a,b \in U_i\]</span> is an equivalence relation.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Ordered Sets and Relations</h2>
<p>In the previous section we defined a relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as a subset of <span class="math inline">\(A\times B\)</span>, and that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is related to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, (<span class="math inline">\(aRb\)</span>), if and only if <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\in R\)</span>. If the two sets are the same set, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, then we say that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is a relation on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>We also defined the following three properties of a relation, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, on a set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reflexive.</strong> The relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is reflexive if <span class="math inline">\(aRa\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(a\in A\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Symmetric.</strong> The relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is symmetric if <span class="math inline">\(aRb\)</span> implies that <span class="math inline">\(bRa\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(a,b\in A\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Transitive.</strong> The relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is transitive if <span class="math inline">\(aRb\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(bRc\)</span> imply that <span class="math inline">\(aRc\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c\in A\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A relation is an equivalence relation if it satisfies all three of these properties. Another type of relation is one that creates an order, or ranking, of the set. A common mathematical topic in this regards are the concepts of “less than” and “less than or equal to”.</p>
<p>We will first explore the relation of “less than”. Since a number cannot be less than itself we see that the relation is not reflexive. We also know that <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b&lt;a\)</span> cannot both be true and so the relation is not symmetric. However, if <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b&lt;c\)</span> we do have that <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;c\)</span>. So this relation of “less than” is transitive. Thus the familiar relation of “less than” is one which is transitive but not reflexive or symmetric.</p>
<p>When we expand the relation to that of “less than or equal to”, we add that <span class="math inline">\(a\leq a\)</span>, resulting in the relation being reflexive. So this is a common relation that is reflexive and transitive, but not symmetric. For example, <span class="math inline">\(1\leq 2\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is not less than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unnamed-chunk-45" class="definition"><strong>Definition 3.3  </strong></span>We define an <strong>order</strong> on a set, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, to be a relation, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, with the following properties.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are two elements of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, then one, and only one, of the statements <span class="math display">\[x&lt;y, \quad x=y, \quad, y&lt;x\]</span> is true.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z \in A\)</span>, and if <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y&lt;z\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;z\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
If a set has an order defined on the set, then we say that it is an <strong>ordered set</strong>.
</div>

<p>Such an order forms a relation that is transitive, but not symmetric or reflexive. As a convenient notation, we will write <span class="math inline">\(x\leq y\)</span> as the negation of <span class="math inline">\(y&lt;x\)</span>. We then see that it is equivalent to the statement that (<span class="math inline">\(x&lt;y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x=y\)</span>).</p>

<p>We will see in Chapter <!--- \ref{ch_number} ---> that the natural numbers, <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2,3,\ldots\}\)</span>, satisfy the well-ordering property, but the real numbers do not.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Equality and Equivalence in the K-12 Curriculum</h2>
<p>We can see from the discussion in the previous two sections that the concept of two things being equivalent mathematically is a very difficult and abstract concept. It is no surprise then that students of all grade levels have many different conceptions and misconceptions revolving around this concept of equality and equivalence.</p>
<p>Since all of the number systems that arise in the elementary and early secondary curriculum have an inherent order described by the <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> symbols, the concept of equality is often described in terms of a balanced scale. Another conception around the equal sign is that two sets of objects have the same number of items, determined by counting the number of objects. This is likely since the concept of equality arises in the first grade where students are only working with whole numbers.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>One of the common misconceptions surrounding the equal sign is that the symbol implies an action of doing some type of computation. For instance, students usually see the equal sign in the context of the type of problems seen in Figure @ref{fig:equality-operation}.</p>
<p>These type of problems promote an operational understanding of the equal sign, rather than a relational or substitutional understanding that is essential for later work <span class="citation">(Gilmore et al., <a href="#ref-Cognition" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>, pp. 145–150)</span>. Because secondary mathematics students maintain many misconceptions about the concept of equality and the meaning of the equal sign, we will take some time to reflect on some key content standards from first grade that have a very strong influence on student success of learning mathematics in the middle school.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="related-content-standards-3" class="unnumbered">Related Content Standards</h4>
<ul>
<li>(1.OA.7) Understand the meaning of the equal sign, and determine if equations involving addition and subtraction are true or false.

<p>We should notice that in standard (1.OA.D.8) that the unknown should not always be at the end of a string of mathematical symbols and is based on educational research that compares students from different cultures and their understanding of the equal sign <span class="citation">(Gilmore et al., <a href="#ref-Cognition" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>, pp. 148–150)</span>. Instead it should be at many different locations in order to make sure that students do not internalize the misconception that the equal sign means to compute. They should instead develop the concept of the equal sign representing two things that have the same value in some way. It is this understanding of two things looking different but representing the same underlying value that causes the equal sign to represent an equivalence.</p>
<p>Another method that may possibly contribute to a more relational understanding of the equal sign is the introduction of the equal sign alongside the greater than (<span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>) and less than (<span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>) symbols to emphasize the role of the equal sign in the comparison of the size of numbers. This comparison concept can be further reinforced with a pan balance (See Figure <a href="ch-equivalence.html#fig:pan-balance">3.4</a>).</p>
<p>This concept of a pan-balance can give students a concrete idea to attach to the meaning of the equal and inequality signs. However, like all good analogies, the pan balance is challenging to use with negative numbers and breaks down if you are comparing numbers in an unordered number system such as the complex numbers.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Expressions, Equations, and Inequalities</h2>
<p>A <strong>numerical expression</strong> is a meaningful string of numbers, operation symbols, and/or grouping symbols. In early elementary grades, examples of numerical expressions include <span class="math display">\[2+6+4, \quad 13-3+2, \quad \mbox{ or } \quad (4+6)+3.\]</span> In upper elementary grades, students are expected to incorporate rational numbers and the operations of multiplication, division, and exponents in order to be comfortable working with such expressions as
<span class="math display">\[3 \times (10+4), \quad \frac{2}{3} \times (12+8), \quad \mbox{ or } \quad  2^3 + \frac{3+2}{7}.\]</span></p>
<p>In the transition from elementary school to secondary schools, students learn to add <strong>variables</strong>, symbols or letters that stand for any number within a specified range of numbers, to these expressions and thus work with <strong>algebraic expressions</strong> such as
<span class="math display">\[100-10\cdot (P-15)^3,  \quad 3xy + 5(x-4)^2-7y^2, \quad 6\cdot (4x+3y), \quad \mbox{ or }\quad  \frac{3x+2}{2x-4}.\]</span></p>

<p>In more advanced courses in secondary school mathematics, algebraic expressions can also include functions giving rise to expressions such as
<span class="math display">\[f(x-h)+k, \quad \sin(3x)-2, \quad \mbox{ or } \quad  \ln(x+3).\]</span></p>
<p>The equivalence of numerical expressions is a key concept in the early elementary grades where students learn to compose and decompose numbers in different ways as they add and subtract numbers using different algorithms. In sixth grade, students are asked to determine the equivalence of two mathematical expressions. This definition that two algebraic expressions are equivalent if they generate the same number regardless of which number is substituted for the variable is one of the first places where students are pushed to move to the abstract realm of equivalence relations. We can verify that this definition of equivalent expressions is an equivalence relation using the fact that equality on the real numbers is an equivalence relation.</p>

<li>(6.EE.4) Identify when two expressions are equivalent (i.e., when the two expressions name the same number regardless of which value is substituted into them).</li>
<li>(6.EE.5) Understand solving an equation or inequality as a process of answering a question: which values from a specified set, if any, make the equation or inequality true? Use substitution to determine whether a given number in a specified set makes an equation or inequality true.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While substituting in values to determine if two expressions are equivalent is the definition of the equivalence, it is almost always impossible to substitute in all possible values for a variable, as there are infinitely many possibilities in most situations. Instead, we determine the equivalency of two expressions by applying various properties of the operations. For example, the distributive property shows us that <span class="math inline">\(3(x+y)\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(3x+3y\)</span>. However, students have to be careful to consider the set of possible numbers for an expression when determining the equivalence of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{x^2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3x^2}{x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3x\)</span>.</p>
<p>An <strong>equation</strong> is a statement that a number or expression is equivalent to a different number or expression. An equation that is true for all values of the variable is called an <strong>identity</strong>. The associative, commutative, and distributive properties of the number systems
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    a+(b+c) &amp;= (a+b)+c \\
    a+b &amp;= b+a \\
    a \times (b+c) &amp;= (a\times b)+(a\times c)
\end{align*}\]</span>
are all common identities. Some other common identities in this regard are the trigonometric identity
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    \cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) &amp;= 1  \\
    \sin(\alpha \pm \beta) &amp;= \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta)\pm \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta) \\
    \cos(2\theta) &amp;= \cos^2(\theta)-\sin^2(\theta)
\end{align*}\]</span>
that are used to simplify trigonometric expressions.</p>
<p>An equation that describes how multiple quantities vary together is usually called a <strong>formula</strong>. These can include the area formula for rectangles defined by <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{Area}=\mbox{width} \times \mbox{height}\)</span> or Boyle’s law where pressure (<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>) is inversely proportional to volume (<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>), i.e. <span class="math inline">\(PV =k\)</span> for some constant <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>While the identity equations hold true irrespective of the values of the variables, it is often the case that equations hold for only some of the possible values for the variables, or possibly even none. We can then <strong>solve</strong> such equations by determining which values, called <strong>solutions to the equation</strong>, for the variables cause the equation to be a true statement.</p>
<p>Similar to equations, <strong>inequalities</strong> are statements that a number or expression is related to a different number or expression in a certain order relation. Some of these inequalities are identities or formulas, such as <span class="math inline">\(x\leq |x|, x\in\mathbb{R}\)</span>, while some have a solution set, such as <span class="math inline">\(x^2+y^2&lt;1\)</span>.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:unnamed-chunk-49" class="definition"><strong>Definition 3.7  </strong></span> Two equations (inequalities) are equivalent if they are true statements for the same values of the variables.
</div>

<p>In the process of finding solutions to equations or inequalities, it is almost always helpful to rewrite an equation or inequality as an equivalent equation or inequality. For instance in an effort to find the solutions to <span class="math display">\[\frac{x^2-10x+21}{3x-12} = \frac{x-5}{x-4}\]</span>
we want to find an expression that is equivalent to the left side of the equation. Such an expression could be <span class="math display">\[\frac{(x-3)(x-7)}{3(x-4)},\]</span> with the equivalency of the expressions verified using the distributive property. Since these two expressions are equivalent, they have the same values for every value of the variable. This means that the original equation is a true statement if, and only if, <span class="math display">\[\frac{(x-3)(x-7)}{3(x-4)}=\frac{x-5}{x-4}\]</span> is a true statement. We also know that if two numbers are the same, then <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> times each of the numbers are also the same. So the original statement is true if, and only if, the equivalent equation
<span class="math display">\[\frac{(x-3)(x-7)}{x-4}=\frac{3(x-5)}{x-4}\]</span> is true. If <span class="math inline">\(x=4\)</span>, then the statement would have no meaning, as division by zero has no meaning. This means that we can eliminate <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> from the set of possible solutions. With <span class="math inline">\(x\neq 4\)</span> we can multiply both sides of the equation by <span class="math inline">\((x-4)\)</span> to generate the equivalent equation, <span class="math display">\[(x-3)(x-7)=3(x-5).\]</span> We can use the distributive property again to create an equivalent equation of <span class="math display">\[x^2-10x+21=3x-15.\]</span> Since we can also add the same expression, <span class="math inline">\(-3x+15\)</span>, to both sides of the equation and create an equivalent equation, we see that the original equation is equivalent to <span class="math display">\[x^2-13x+36=0\]</span> as long as <span class="math inline">\(x\neq 4\)</span>. Using the distributive property, we see that this equation is equivalent to <span class="math display">\[(x-4)(x-9)=0.\]</span> So the original equation is a true statement if, and only if, <span class="math inline">\((x-4)(x-9)=0\)</span> is a true statement and <span class="math inline">\(x\neq 4\)</span>. This only occurs when the variable, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, is equal to <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span>.</p>
<p>Through this process we can see how equivalence of equations is essential in the process of finding solutions to equations. This means that as students make the transition from elementary to secondary, it is important for teachers to be understanding of the challenge of thinking about equivalent expressions and to be explicit about this relationship.</p>
